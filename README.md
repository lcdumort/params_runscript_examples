# ParAMS runscript examples
This repository contains a few simple, documented run-scripts to use plams and ParAMS. These are, more or less, specifically aimed to be used on computers on the IFP-network (i.e. that can access the IFP-licenses and cluster). Moreover, minimal bash-scripts to run the calculations on the IFP-cluster are provided as well.
